# Turtle Blocks - A Turtle Coin Blockchain Explorer
![Turtle Coin Logo](/images/green_logo.png?raw=true "Turtle coin logo")
# This repository requires the latest version of turtle coin (NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 0.2.2)
    The RpcServer did not output the difficulty by default on `f_blocks_list_json`.
    The fix has now been added to turtle coin, you can view the PR here
    https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/pull/7

    Without this update it will require an additional request to the daemon per block
    loaded on home.html, to get each blocks difficulty.

    This might not be an issue with early on with low users, but a spike in users
    could cost extra recourses (therefore more $/Â£) in cloud hosting senarios

Most of my changes can be viewed by searching for "NOTE"

## Changes
- Updated the API's to work
- Removed white version of the site, because nobodys eyes desrve that (could easily be re-enabled)

- Updated a foreach loop on getPoolTransactions() on homepage because it didnt
    work

- Changed the default langauge to en (also removed nav bar item "UA" due to the code
    being implement twice its better being re-written so the javascript only
    is located in one place)

- Removed date from "Transaction Pool" on homepage because it isn't included
    in the function f_on_transactions_pool_json

-  Update "Pool" page so the javascript works with the format the pools are
    returning now

##  Haven't done / problems
 - Removed alot of instances of getReadableCoins
